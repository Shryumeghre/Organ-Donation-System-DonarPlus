                            <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
                            <p>The essential aspect of organ donation after its availability is the immediate identification of a donor and the secure transfer of organs. With the advent of machine-to-machine communication, devices can interact autonomously, ensuring swift actions without human intervention. These systems provide convenience to device owners and facilitate various transactions while maintaining records. Blockchain technology is already in use to track these transactions, ensuring data privacy, fraud prevention, and compliance with medical legal standards. The integration of e-government applications, TeleMedicine, and Artificial Intelligence in health services has also been examined.</p>
                            <p>The impact of sharing patient and disease data among healthcare entities via smart contracts has been studied. Blockchain technology can eliminate inefficiencies and reduce costs by enabling transactions without a central authority through smart contracts. Blockchain ledgers, with verifiable time-stamped records, could manage document changes and prevent data tampering, offering a reliable platform for transferring entities like organs. According to NASSCOM, blockchain-induced productivity and cost reductions could add up to USD 5 billion to the Indian economy by 2023. India is at the forefront of sophisticated blockchain applications, such as using blockchain to store property records in Andhra Pradesh.</p>

                            <h2>Organ Donation</h2>
                            <p>Organ donation involves giving a body part (organ) to someone with end-stage organ disease in need of a transplant. Organs that can be donated include the kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, and small bowel, along with tissues such as corneas, heart valves, skin, and bone. Tissues consist of groups of cells performing specific functions, such as bones, skin, the cornea of the eye, heart valves, blood vessels, nerves, and tendons.</p>

                        <div id="legal-framework" class="card">
                            <h2>Legal Framework in India</h2>
                            <p>The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, governs organ donation in India, allowing both deceased and living donors. The law recognizes brain death as a form of death. The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) oversees the procurement, allocation, and distribution of organs nationwide. Despite performing the second-highest number of transplants globally in 2019, India has a low donation rate of 0.65 per million population, compared to countries like Spain (35.1 pmp) and the United States (21.9 pmp). According to the World Health Organization, only about 0.01% of Indians donate their organs after death. Factors contributing to this include lack of public awareness, religious or superstitious beliefs, and stringent laws.</p>

                            <h2>Types of Donors</h2>
                            <h3>Living Donors</h3>
                            <p>Living donors can donate:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>One kidney</li>
                                <li>A portion of the pancreas</li>
                                <li>Part of the liver</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Living donors must be over 18 and typically donate to immediate family members or, in special cases, out of affection for the recipient.</p>

                            <h4>Types of Living Donors:</h4>
                            <h5>Living Near Related Donors</h5>
                            <p>Includes parents, siblings, children, grandparents, and grandchildren (THOA Rules 2014). Spouses are also considered near relatives.</p>

                            <h5>Living Non-Near Relative Donors</h5>
                            <p>Individuals who are not near relatives but donate out of affection or for special reasons.</p>

                            <h5>Swap Donors</h5>
                            <p>When a donor is incompatible with their recipient, swapping donors between two pairs is allowed, provided both pairs have matching donors.</p>

                            <h3>Deceased Donors</h3>
                            <p>Anyone can be an organ and tissue donor after death (brainstem or cardiac death). Consent from the next of kin or a person in lawful possession of the body is required. Deceased donors may donate organs such as kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas, and intestines, as well as tissues like corneas, bones, skin, and blood vessels. Brainstem death allows for the donation of up to 37 different organs and tissues.</p>

                            <h2>Organ Transplant</h2>
                            <p>An organ transplant involves transferring an organ from a donor to a recipient to replace a damaged or missing organ. It is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage organ failure. The success of organ transplants depends on various factors, including the compatibility of the donor and recipient, the health of the donor organ, and the recipient's condition.</p>

                            <p>A Green Corridor is a special route set up in cooperation with local authorities to ensure quick and efficient transportation of harvested organs to the transplant hospital. This involves coordinated efforts from police, traffic, and airport authorities to create a clear path for ambulances, ensuring timely delivery of organs for transplantation.</p>
